The following duplicate entries exist in the V13 library.
If your name exists to the right of these, please advise me which is correct.
I intend to update my files with:
	IFE	VERSION-14.
	ERR	!Fix such and such a problem ... to be sure V14 isn't bad too.
	ENDIF	VERSION-14.
At least if I forget the problem by the time we re-release, it'll get flagged!
	Thanks ... rich
